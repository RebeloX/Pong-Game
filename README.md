Pong-Game
=========

Introduction
------------

This is my first game using Unity3D Engine, I also used the assets from Brackeys and the tutorials, the repository as the sources
and the builds.

Source
-------

The soucres includes:

- Assets downloaded from http://brackeys.com/
 - Audio
 - Images
- Scripting which uses Javascript
- Other unity files

Build
-------

There are two types of build, the first one it's a stand-alone game, which has an .exe file and the data,
you can also generate an instaler using [Actual Installer](http://www.actualinstaller.com/). The other build its and web-browser
game, which includes the .html file and .unity file. To put the game online you can use a free webhost, e.g [000webhost](000webhost)
